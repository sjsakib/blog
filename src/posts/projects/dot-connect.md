A turn based two player game built on MERN stack technologies. This was my first project with react. Since it was my first serious JavaScript project, I tried to use as less packages as possible so that I could learn and understand things deeply. But this was obviously a bad idea. I didn't even use basic packages like _body-parser_. This project seems very crude now. Maybe I'll update it someday.

## Features

- Play online against a friend in real time. Create a game and send the link to a friend.
- Play with strangers from lobby.
- Watch games being played by others. Well, that was an unintended feature ðŸ˜›
- Sign in with facebook to save progress and scores.
- Compete in the _Top chart_

## Rules of the game

The game starts with a grid of dots. Each player in turn connects two dots vertically or horizontally. If this connection makes a box, he gets a point and another move. No move can be passed. When the grid is complete, the player with most points wins.

## Key Technologies

In the fronted-

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux)
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Socket.IO Client](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client)

In the backend-

- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- Mongo
- [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose)
- [Socket.IO](https://github.com/socketio/)

## Run this on your own machine

You will need to have node, npm and yarn installed.

```bash
# First clone the repository with git
git clone https://github.com/sjsakib/dot-connect.git

# Then move inside the project, install the client side dependencies and run the front-end
cd dot-connect
yarn install
yarn start

# Now open a new shell window and move to the server directory
# install the server side dependencies and run the server
cd server
yarn install
yarn start
```

An internet connection is required for the app to work. Because it uses a sandbox database instance from [mlab](https://mlab.com/) instead of local installation of Mongo.
