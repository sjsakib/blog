# Mobile Mela
A shop management app with web.py and JS/jQuery

This project is __terrible__. Because I, 

* Solved many common problems in peculiar way
* Used API and jQuery to build and render pages, while templates could make things much simpler
* Didn't bother to follow any standards
* Wrote no comments

When I did it, I didn't know much about development. And I tried to get it done in the shortest possible time. But I still __love__ it. Because,

* Learned to use pure SQL
* Solved many problems in my own way
* Did things the hard way
* Understood how fully-featured frameworks can help with things

So, I thought I should keep it as a memory of my first development days. Please don't read the codes :wink:
