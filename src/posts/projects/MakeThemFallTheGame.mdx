# MakeThemFallTheGame
This is a simple game made with Processing and JBox2D. This is my first big project. While reading the book 'Nature of code' I thought of making something my own. So I made this. It gave me a lot of experience. First time I faced the challenges of software development. Like planning, maintaining code etc. That time I didn't have git. Now I am learning about git and putting this here to test git.
