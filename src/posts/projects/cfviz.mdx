#### Issues
* When somebody searches for a handle that doesn't exists, we get  Cross-Origin Request blocked and the status code becomes 0 in jQuery. So we can't determine if the user doesn't really exists or some other network problem occurs.
* Firefox hangs for a while when drawing the tags comparison chart. Probably because it's big. I have plan to divide that chart in two parts.
* When counting number of solved problems, some problems that appear both on div 1 and div 2  get counted twice.
