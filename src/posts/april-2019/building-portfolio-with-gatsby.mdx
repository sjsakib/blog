import Tree from './Tree';

When I saw that `sakib.dev` was available, I couldn't resist myself. How could I? A `.dev` with just my short name, can you believe it? Even though I already had a domain name, I purchased it.

So now that I had this cool domain name, the task of building a portfolio could no longer be procrastinated. I was already a fan of static site generation. I used [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in the past. So, obviously I chose [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

### Do I need a blog?

The primary purpose of the site is to show off my projects and skills. And I am writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sjsakib) for a while now. The question is do I need a personal blog? I mean what's the point of writing on a personal blog that no one would visit when I can write on medium and get a good channel to reach readers? But then when I write on medium, it doesn't feel like the contents are totally mine.

So what I decided was from now on, I will write on my personal blog and then I will import the articles on medium.

### Blogging with Gatsby

Adding a blog to a Gatsby site is easy. There are many ways, I went for [Mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx). With that, I write my blog posts in `.md` or `.mdx` with additional info in _frontmatter_. Then using the node API of Gatsby, I query for every post file in the filesystem and create a static page for every post using a template. And if I want, I can import and drop React components in my markdown. Like this one:

<Tree />

It's cool. Right?

I also pull my medium posts, and link them from the site. If a post is published both on medium and this site, I add the medium slug of the post in the frontmatter of the `.md` file. So, no duplicate posts are shown.

### Images

The cool thing about Gatsby is that there's a lot of plugins out there that has already solved most common problems for you. Like optimizing images. With [this](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/) plugin, I can drop images of any quality in my source directory and then query only for the size I want to use, or for a set of url to different sizes of the image. So in smaller or low res displays smaller size of the image is loaded. This gives the site a performance boost. It uses [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) internally to process the images. I can also crop the image [smartly](http://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/api-resize/). I was blown away by how much this plugin does.

### Design

I'm not very good with design. I can tell when design looks good. But I don't know how to _make_ a design look good. But this time, instead of just grabbing a free template, I tried actually to design the site myself.

Since Gatsby lets you use react, you get to use all the libraries written for react. So I just grabbed [react-reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/) for some cool animations.

### Deploying

Deploying with CD was effortless with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Some other features

- All pages are pre-fetched with ajax. This comes out of the box with Gatsby. It's nice to see pages load instantly.

- Syntax highlighting is done with [gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs/). I modified a prismjs theme for me.

- Comments are handled with facebook comments plugin.

- Wrote a small script to fetch the README files of my projects on GitHub and generate _project posts_ with them by adding additional info in the frontmatter.

If you like this site, feel free to clone it and customize it further for yourself. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/sjsakib/blog). Many things like social links, skills didn't have to be hard codded, but they are. Sorry about that.
