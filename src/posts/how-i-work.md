title: What I think makes me a good software engineer

allowComments: false

* **I know my tools.** Whatever tool I use, be it a language, a framework or a pattern, I try to keep a clear understanding of the basics, the values it provides and at least some ideas how it might work under the hood.

* **I follow best practices when it makes sense and avoid reinviting the wheel.** When solving a problem I try to find out how other people have solved similar problems. Then I asses if that is also the optimal solution in my situation or if I need to go with a completely different or modified solution.

* **I don't just write code that works.** When a piece of code or system is not ideal in terms of maintainability, security, performance or reliability, it makes me kind of finicky. I try to come back and take them as close to perfection as time allows.

* **I am also a pragmatist.** I focus on getting the job done avoiding premature optimization, over engineering, hypes around so called *cool* tools and technologies. Sometimes it might be contradictory to the previous point, but I try to find a balance between the two.

* **I don't keep myself confined in my comfort zone.** I am open to experimenting and doing things differently. Learning, assessing and using new tools and technologies if it makes sense.

* **I can participate in product development.** I can work with product managers, designers and other stakeholders to build a product that is technically sane.

* **I am self motivated.** I am passionate about building solutions that improves lives one experience at a time while adding value for everyone involved.
