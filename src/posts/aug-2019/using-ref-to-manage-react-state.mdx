I was facing a problem, let's say at some point in a react app, I get a list of cities and I have to make individual API calls to fetch info about the cities. I want to update the UI whenever a single request completes.

So the solution that comes to mind first is this:

```js
function MyComponent() {
  const [cityList, setCityList] = useState([]);
  const [cityData, setCityData] = useState({});
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const res = // calling api for city list
    setCityList(res.data);
    res.data.forEach(city => {
      const res = // calling api for `city` data
      setCityData({...cityData, [city.id]: res.data});
    });
  }, []);

  return (...) // render UI
}
```

As you will notice, this code doesn't work. Because the callback passed to `useEffect` will always have `cityData` from the first render, which is `{}`.  As a result, `cityData` will always have only the last received data.

If we were using class based components, this wouldn't have been a problem. Because `this.state` always gives access to the latest state. 

### So?

What I did is kept the `cityData` in a ref. The [useRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref) hook can be used for persisting mutable objects between renders while using hook based components. But updating that ref doesn't trigger a render. So I used a pseudo state to trigger update.

```js
function MyComponent() {
  const [cityList, setCityList] = useState([]);
  const cityData = useRef({}).current;
  const [_, triggerUpdate] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const res = // calling api for city list
    setCityList(res.data);

    res.data.forEach(city => {
      const res = // calling api for `city` data 
      cityData[city.id] = res.data;
      triggerUpdate(Math.random()); // The random thing is probably not necessary
    });
  }, []);

  return (...) // render UI
}
```

And it works. I'm not sure if it is the best solution. What do you think? See any flaws in the solution? How would you solve this specific problem?
