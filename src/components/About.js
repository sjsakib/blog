      <p>
        I don't remember when and how I came to know about the kind of machines
        they call computers. As far as I can remember, I had been dreamig about
        workding with them. Every time I saw the movement of the mouse cursor,
        heard the sound of a &lsquo;click&rsquo;, something happened inside me.
        I got my first computer when I was seventeen.

        I'm doing my graduation in Mathematics, but as you might have guessed,
        I'm eger to build a career in IT. If I've learned a single thing in all
        those years, that is how to learn things. I'm a fast learner and fast
        adopter. I can flexibily switch between technologies. My current focus
        is frontend development.
